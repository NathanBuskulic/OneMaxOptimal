# OneMaxOptimal
3rd year internship source code for calculation of optimal parameters to solve the oneMax problem.

# BinVal

You will find in this file some code to compute optimal values for the BinVal problem.

# EmpiricalResults

You will find here codes to compute empirical data from parameters compited in **Summary**.

# optimalEA

Here are all the results from 100 to 10000 of optimal parameters for a (1+1)EA.

# optimalRLS

Here are all the results from 100 to 10000 of optimal parameters for a RLS.

# Summary

The interesting part, it's here where all the code (and the results) is stocked to compute optimal or drift-maximizer parameters for different algorithms
